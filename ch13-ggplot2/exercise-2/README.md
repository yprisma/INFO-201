# Exercise-2
In this exercise, you'll practice using the `ggplot2` library and the Grammar of Graphics to create more advanced data visualizations.

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
