# Exercise-4
In this exercise, you'll use data from the 2017 Washington elections to explore [voter turnout](https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/current/Turnout.html) and compare it to more general data about Washington's [counties](http://data.spokesman.com/census/2010/washington/counties/). The data has been downloaded for you, and can be prepared using the `prep-data.R` file.
