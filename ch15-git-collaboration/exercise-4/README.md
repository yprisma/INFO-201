# Exercise-4
In this exercise, you'll be working with a partner to resolve merge conflicts. Learning how to successfully collaborate in a team to pull and merge one another's changes will make your life a lot easier than juggling different files. With this exercise you should practice using both **branches** and **rebases**. While you will be working in teams you should avoid communicating your changes to the code in order to stimulate a "real-world" scenario. Note that there is no completed branch for this exercise.   


As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to Github.
