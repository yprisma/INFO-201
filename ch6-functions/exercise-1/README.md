# Exercise-1

In this exercise, you'll practice writing and executing some basic R
functions. As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this
repository, follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then
`add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to
GitHub.
