# Exercise-2

In this exercise, you'll practice writing and executing some basic R
functions. Note, this exercise requires some knowledge of vectors, as
described in [chapter-7](https://info201.github.io/vectors.html).

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository,
follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and
`commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
