# Exercise-3
In this short exercise, you'll practice using the pipe operator (`%<%`) to chain functions together in R. 

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
