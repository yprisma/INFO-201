# Exercise-4
In this exercise, you'll practice using `dplyr` functions by asking questions about the `flights` dataset described [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html).

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
