### -------------------- Exercise 1: Creating data frames --------------------

## Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored in the first 5 games
                           # Hint: google "Seahawks scores", or check the football database:
                           # http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/seattle-seahawks/results
                           # here 'Result' displays scores, 'L' stands for loss, 'W' for win

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have allowed to be scored against them in the first 5 games


# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe


# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points


# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks won


# Create a vector of the opponents


# Add the vector of opponents into the data frame
