# Create a vector of 100 Credit Card Users

# Create a vector of amount of money owed using the runif function

# Create a vector of amount of money paid (that are typically higher than the amount Owed) (use runif again)

# Create a data.frame by combining the vectors

# Create a column "Difference" that stores the difference between amount Paid and amount Owed

# Create a column that is TRUE if the person Paid more than they Owe

# What was the amount Owed of User 57?

# How many users paid more than they owe?

# What was the total amount of money paid for all users?

# What was the name of the user who had the highest "Difference"?

# Who was the user with the largest amount paid? 

# What was the average "Difference"?

# challenge: how to use dplyr to answer these questions?
