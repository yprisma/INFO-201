# Exercise 6: Husky Football 2016 Season
# Read in the Husky Football 2016 game data into a variable called `husky.games.2016`

# Create a vector of the teams that the Huskies played against during that season
# Call this vector `not.huskies`. You'll need to convert this column to a vector


# Create a vector of the their final scores for the games
# Call this variable `husky.scores`


# Create 2 variables called `rushing.yards` and `passing.yards` to represent the yards the Huskies rushed and passed


# Create a variabled called `combined.yards` that is the total yardage of the Huskies for each game


# What is the score of the game where the Huskies had the most combined yards?


# Write a function `MostYardsScore` that takes in a dataframe parameter `games` and returns a descriptive sentence
# about the game that was played that had the most yards scored in it.
# Take note of the steps from above including the opposing team, score, and date the game was played


# What was the highest yardage game so far last season?
# Hint: Read in the dataset titled `huskies_2015.csv` and save it as a variable


### Bonus ###
# When working with data, you will often find yourself manually adding data into your dataset.
# This bonus will help you practice such skills.
# Using resources online, find out whether each game was played at home or away.
# Create a vector `where.played` that corresponds to what you found.
# Add the vector `where.played` as a new column to `husky.games.2016`
# Hint: For bowl games simply listing "bowl" will be fine.
