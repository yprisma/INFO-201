# Exercise-2

In this exercise, we're going to practice if/else statement. Have fun! : )


Nearly all of our R exercises will follow the same format, requiring the following steps:



1. As you've done before, fork this repository to your own GitHub account

2. Clone the repository to your machine

3. Open the `exercise.R` file (in Rstudio or an editor), and follow the instructions there.

4. When you're done, `add` and `commit` your changes

5. Push your changes back to GitHub
