# Exercise-1: practice with basic syntax

# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born

hometown <- "Bellevue"

# Assign your name to the variable `my.name`

my.name <- "Ryan"

# Assign your height to a variable `my.height`

my.height <- "5 feet 9 inches"

# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have

puppes <- 2

# Create a variable `puppy.price`, which is how expensive you think a puppy is

puppy.price <- 50.00

# Create a variable `total.cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies

total.cost <- 100.00

# Create a boolean variable `too.expensive`, set to true if the cost is greater than $1,000

too.expensive <- FALSE

# Create a variable `max_puppies`, which is the number of puppies you can afford for $1K.  Compute this

max_puppies <- 20

# value in R, not just assign!
