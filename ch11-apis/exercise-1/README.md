# Exercise-1

In this exercise, you'll practice reading the API of and requesting
data from the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) API. To better
understand the different possible endpoints, see
<http://data.unhcr.org/wiki/index.php/API_Documentation.html>.

You can also find a set of interactive visualizations about this data
(and more!) at <http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations>. For example,
this page about the
[Syrian Refugee Critis](http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php).

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository,
follow the instructions in `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit`
your changes so that you can `push` them back up to Github.
