# Exercise-3

In this exercise, you'll practice debugging a function. This isn't
directly related to the use of APIs, but provides important practice
as the complexity of your functions begins to scale.

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository,
follow the instructions in `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit`
your changes so that you can `push` them back up to Github.
