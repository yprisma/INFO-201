The data provided is collected from Civic Information API provided by Google (API Link: `base.url`), which identifies the Government Representatives for a certain address. For example, my address is `my.address` and there are `nrow(representatives.df)` individuals who represent that address.

I have also collected data from the ProPublica API (API Link: `base.url.2`). This data depicts all of the members of the House of Representative, including a little information about each individual representative (such as phone number, office location, votes, and more).

```{r}

positions <- select(results$offices, name)

top_position <- positions[1:3, ]
bottom_position <- positions[4:nrow(positions) ,]
positions <- cbind(c(as.character(top_position), "United States Senate", as.character(bottom_position)))

full_top <- positions[1:9, ]
full_bottom <- positions[10: nrow(positions), ]
final_positions <- cbind(c(full_top, "WA State House District 5", full_bottom))


representatives.df$position <- final_positions

```

We shall look at all of the representatives for the state of Washington, where the address was given. We shall break it down to party affiliations for each representative using a _horizontal barplot_

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
