# Team Diversity

**Team Members: ** Ryan Peart, Lucas Woo, Sam Yoshikawa, Victoria Pressman

**Purpose: ** Our project is a shiny application that allows users to search for certain company’s stock data (including the Market Opening Price, Market Closing Price, and the High’s and Low’s for a specific date or range of dates inputted by the user). Users may also view graphs that show an overview of the different market sector index trends over a selected timeline.

**Data info: ** Our stock market data is retrieved from Google Finance that is offered through a simple API on the Quandl platform.
